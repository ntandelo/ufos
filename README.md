# UFO Sightings

##Purpose of Website
A dynamic, in-depth analysis of UFO sightings which allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time

##Process
On this web page, you can pick between several elements to filter for different types of UFO sightings: city, state, country, shape, at date of sighting:

Every time you select a parameter, the web page will automatically update its filter to reflect only data which matches that parameter. The table will also automatically update. You can use any of the filters you want, and you don't have to use all of them.

##Summary
A drawback of this is that the filter does not automatically clear, so you will have to manually clear each search criteria each time. This can be dealt with by making the filter clear itself in the code.
